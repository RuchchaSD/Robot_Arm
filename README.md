# Arduino 4-DOF Robot Arm with Inverse Kinematics

![Robot Arm]([https://github.com/RuchchaSD/Robot_Arm/assets/65414545/62e858a4-9c7c-42ff-88b9-1041f6ad5b36))

## Overview

This GitHub repository hosts the code and design files for a 4-degree-of-freedom (4-DOF) robot arm controlled using Arduino. The project's primary focus is on implementing inverse kinematics to control the arm's end-effector position accurately.

## Features

- **4 Degrees of Freedom**: The robot arm is equipped with four MG90 servos, allowing it to move in various directions.
- **Inverse Kinematics**: Utilizes inverse kinematics algorithms to calculate joint angles necessary to position the end-effector at specific coordinates.
- **Laser-Cut Acrylic Design**: The mechanical structure of the robot arm is designed using laser-cut acrylic boards, providing a sturdy and lightweight frame.
- **Arduino Control**: The Arduino microcontroller is used to interface with and control the servos, making it easy to program and customize arm movements.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Implement a user interface (e.g., serial communication, buttons, or an app) to input target coordinates and control the robot arm effortlessly.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation, including setup instructions, wiring diagrams, and explanations of inverse kinematics calculations.

## Getting Started
